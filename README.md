# daily song recommendation discord bot
## @authors Jackson Parsells and Emma Paterson
Utilizes the spotify API to generate a new song of the day to listen to! New
recommendation will be sent at 7 am local time!

TODOs:
add filtering out genres in order to allow people who use spotify for white
noise to still get accurate recommendations.

To use:

- subscribe with the `!subscribe` command, this will prompt you to enter
  spotify login in order for the bot to DM you personalized recommendations
  each day
- unsubscribe with the `!unsubscribe` command, this will remove you from
  receiving daily spotify recommendations
